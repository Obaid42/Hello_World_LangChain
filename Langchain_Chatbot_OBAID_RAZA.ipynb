            "**1. Data Dependency:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Machine Learning:** ML algorithms can work effectively with smaller, structured datasets.  They often require significant feature engineering – manually selecting and transforming relevant features from the raw data to improve model accuracy.  The algorithm learns patterns from these pre-processed features.  For example, to predict house prices, you might manually select features like size, location, number of bedrooms, etc., and feed them to the ML model.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Deep Learning:** DL algorithms thrive on massive amounts of data. The more data they are trained on, the better they perform. They excel at automatically learning features from raw data without much manual intervention.  In the house price prediction example, a DL model might be fed images of houses, location data, and text descriptions, and it would learn relevant features (like architectural style, neighborhood quality) on its own.  This automatic feature extraction is a key advantage.\n",

Data scientists spend considerable time selecting, extracting, and transforming relevant features from the raw data. This is a time-consuming and often complex process, requiring domain expertise.  The quality of the model heavily relies on the quality of the engineered features.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Deep Learning:**  Minimizes the need for manual feature engineering. Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for images and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequences, can automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, extracting increasingly complex features from raw data. This is a major advantage, reducing the reliance on human expertise in feature selection.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Deep Learning:** Employs complex algorithms with multiple layers (hence \"deep\").  These include artificial neural networks (ANNs) with many hidden layers, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for generating new data.  These models are much more computationally intensive and often harder to interpret.\n",
